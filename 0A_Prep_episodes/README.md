# Calculate episodes

**Input:** .mat files (one per reindeer and season) with scoring and artefact info.  
  
**Output:** .mat file with episode info (start, end and length of each episode), scoring info and artefact info.  


**A_episodes_BL:** For 24-hour baseline recording. NREM sleep, REM sleep, rumination and wake episodes.  
  
**B_episodes_all:** For the whole recording (approx. 91 hours). NREM sleep, REM sleep, rumination and wake episodes.  
  
**C_episodesSleep_all:** For the whole recording (approx. 91 hours). NREM sleep, REM sleep and rumination combined. For the definition of "inactivity episodes".  
  
**D_episodes5min_all:** Same as "B_episodes_all", but up to 5 min wake-breakes allowed (instead of 1 min). For the calculation of SWA during long NREM sleep episodes.
