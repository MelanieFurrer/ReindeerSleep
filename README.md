# ReindeerSleep

All the MATLAB and R scripts used to analyse reindeer sleep EEG data can be found here.
Data was collected in Dec. 2019, July 2020, and Sep. 2020 in four reindeer (one missing for December due to bad data quality) across ca. 90 hours including an adaptation phase, 2x 2h sleep restriction (12 - 14; 00 - 02) and a 24 hour baseline recording (06 - 06).
