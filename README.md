# ReindeerSleep

All MATLAB and R scripts used to analyse reindeer sleep EEG data to produce results for publication “Reindeer in the Arctic reduce sleep need during rumination” (DOI xxx) can be found here.
Data was collected end of Dec. 2019, beginning of July 2020, and middle of Sep. 2020 in four reindeer (one missing for December due to bad data quality) across 91 hours (14:00 - 9:00) including an adaptation phase (43 h, 14:00 - 09:00), 2x 2h sleep restriction (12 - 14; 00 - 02) and a 24 hour baseline recording (05 - 05).  



- **Preprocessing:** Filter, downsample, artefact-rejection, calculate power, align data   
- **Calculate SWA:** Calculate and normalize SWA values for all further analyses using SWA (SWA-sleep deprivation, SWA across and within rumination/NREM sleep, Process S)   
- **Prepare episodes:** Calculate NREM sleep, REM sleep and RUM episodes for all further analyses depending on episode information
